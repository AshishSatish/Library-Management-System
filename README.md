# Library Management System
The provided C program implements a basic library management system using doubly linked lists. It allows users to perform operations such as adding books, borrowing books, returning books, and displaying the library and student requests.
The program defines two structures: Book and StudentRequest, which are used to represent books in the library and student borrowing requests, respectively. It maintains a global doubly linked list of books and a separate list for student requests.
The main functionalities of the program include:
Adding a new book to the library
Allowing students to borrow books
Allowing students to return borrowed books
Displaying all books in the library
Displaying active student requests
The program also includes an interactive menu-driven interface that allows users to select different options for managing the library.
This program demonstrates the use of data structures like doubly linked lists for managing book records and student requests efficiently.
